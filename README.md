# dis6502

An experimental project to learn about the 6502 CPU.

After writing one [assembler/disassembler](https://github.com/feliposz/nand2tetris/tree/master/projects/06) for the [Hack computer](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) I decided to give it a try on writing a simple disassembler for a "real" CPU.
